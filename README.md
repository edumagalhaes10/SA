Sensorização e Ambiente - Trabalho Prático
---

The project is related to Intelligent Systems. The objective of this project
was to develop an app based on sensorization, designed and thought by the
group. The outcome of the project was an Android App that promotes Tourist
Attractions through the use of Geofences. Each attraction had geofences
defined to send notifications and register visits, when the user is nearby. The
app also used a weather API to inform the user about weather and pollution
of the zone he is at the moment.
